To achieve the functionality of sending the collected data to your email address and also allowing users to enter their email address to receive a confirmation email, we need a backend server to handle email sending. Since this involves server-side processing, it cannot be done solely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the front end. However, I can provide you with a high-level overview of how you can set up the backend and use JavaScript to make an API call to it.

Here's the updated JavaScript code for the front end:

Keep in mind that the above code assumes the existence of a backend server that can handle API requests for storing data and sending emails. The backend should have endpoints to handle data submission and email sending. Additionally, you should replace the apiUrl and emailApiUrl variables with the actual URLs of your backend server's API endpoints.

Creating a backend server and handling email sending requires server-side programming and configuration, which is beyond the scope of this response. If you're not familiar with setting up a backend server, you can consider using existing Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platforms that offer serverless functions to handle API calls and email sending. Examples of such platforms are Firebase Functions, AWS Lambda, or Netlify Functions. These platforms allow you to create server-side functions and host them without managing the server infrastructure.
